Bitcount Algorithms

1. Iterative bit counting.
2. Sparse Ones and Dense Ones were first described by Peter Wegner in  "A Technique for Counting Ones in a Binary Computer", Communications of the ACM, Volume 3 (1960) Number 5, page 322.
3. Pre computed look up table for 8bits and 16bits.
4. Parallel Bit Counting.
5. Nifty Parallel According to Don Knuth (The Art of Computer Programming Vol IV, p 11), in the first textbook on programming, The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer by Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill (1957, reprinted 1984), pages 191--193 presented Nifty Parallel Count by D B Gillies and J C P Miller.
6. MIT HAKMEN -only works for 32 bits-
